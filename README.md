# Simon Says Game

## Overview

This is a Simon Says game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game starts when the user presses any key, and the objective is to follow the sequence of button flashes displayed by the game. As the game progresses, the sequence becomes more challenging, testing the user's memory and attention.

## Features

- **Start Game:** The game starts when the user presses any key.
- **Random Sequence:** The game generates a random sequence of button flashes that the user needs to follow.
- **Increasing Difficulty:** The sequence length increases with each round, making the game progressively harder.
- **Visual and Audio Feedback:** Button flashes and sounds provide feedback for user interaction and correct sequences.
- **Game Over:** The game ends if the user presses a button out of the sequence, with a game over message displayed.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for the structure of the game.
- **CSS** for styling the game interface.
- **JavaScript** for the game logic, including sequence generation, user input handling, and game state management.
